  <p>Glen Wesley came to Australia in 1988 because his dad was looking for new
    job opportunities in Brisbane and he said, “I would go back to New Zealand,
    But I also like it here.” and “I didn’t really have an option I would have
    preferred to stay in New Zealand with my friends.” He has lived in Australia
    for 33 years since 1988. He has lived in Queensland and Victoria and has
    worked in the northern territory and South Australia as a photographer for
    the Air Force mainly with film but a bit with digital cameras as this was
    the 90s. He came over here with his brother mother and father and broght
    along a suitcase of belongings thats it.</p>
